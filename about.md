# About Galoy

Galoy is an open-source Bitcoin banking infrastructure company that empowers communities and businesses to build their own Bitcoin-native financial services. We believe that Bitcoin adoption happens at the grassroots level, and our mission is to provide the tools and infrastructure needed to make that adoption seamless and accessible.

## Our Mission

We're building the financial infrastructure for a Bitcoin-native world. Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for communities, businesses, and developers to integrate Bitcoin into their daily operations without needing to become Bitcoin experts themselves.

## Our Story

Founded by Bitcoin enthusiasts and developers, Galoy emerged from the recognition that while Bitcoin is revolutionary, the infrastructure to use it in everyday commerce was still too complex for most people and communities. We set out to change that by creating simple, reliable, and open-source tools that anyone can use.

## What We Believe

### Open Source Everything
We believe that financial infrastructure should be transparent, auditable, and owned by the communities that use it. That's why all of our code is open source and available for anyone to inspect, modify, and contribute to.

### Bitcoin for Everyone
Bitcoin should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical expertise. We build tools that hide the complexity while preserving the power and sovereignty that Bitcoin provides.

### Community First
The future of Bitcoin adoption will be driven by communities, not corporations. We design our products to empower local economies and help communities become more financially sovereign.

## Our Team

Galoy is built by a distributed team of Bitcoin developers and community organizers from around the world. We're united by our belief in Bitcoin's potential to create a more open and equitable financial system.

## Get Involved

Galoy is more than just a company â€“ it's a community. Whether you're a developer wanting to contribute code, a community organizer looking to bring Bitcoin to your area, or just someone curious about what we're building, we'd love to hear from you.
